# IOTDeviceApp
+--------------------------------+

Kalypso is the core IoT device software running on Raspberry PI. It collects water parameters from different digital sensors. Can be deployed at remote locations.

# Technology:-
Java, IoT Interface, ARM

# Design IDE:-
Eclipse

# OverView:-

Kalypso is designed for running device hardware 24x7 with moderate fault tolerance, collecting sensor data and managing communication resources with different micro services from remote locations.
All of these have been done by keeping in mind such that we can upgrade the device software as frequently as possible based on client feedback. 
Kalypso monitors real life data 24x7 even if when there is temporary communication interrupt with its host and comes back as online as soon as service resumes.
It is reconfigurable at any time by its authorized host based on real life situations / seasonal requirement.
